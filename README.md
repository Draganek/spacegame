# Space Invaders Game

## Project Overview

"Space Invaders" is a dynamic space-themed game developed using React, TypeScript, and Howler.js for sound management. The game allows players to control a spaceship that shoots at incoming waves of enemies. The enemies move across the screen, bouncing off the edges, and each level increases their speed and spawn frequency.

## Key Features

- **Touch Controls:** Implemented touch controls for smooth spaceship movement on mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Enemy Generation:** Enemies are generated dynamically, moving diagonally and bouncing off the edges of the screen.
- **Difficulty Levels:** The game increases in difficulty by speeding up enemies and increasing their spawn rate with each level.
- **User Interface:** Displays the player's score, game level, and remaining lives with a flexible interface.
- **Sound Effects:** Integrated Howler.js to manage game sounds, such as shooting and collisions.
- **Responsiveness:** Styled with `rem` and `vh/vw` units to ensure responsiveness across various screen resolutions.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript:** Provides type safety and enhances code quality.
- **Howler.js:** Manages game sounds.
- **CSS:** Ensures responsive design for different devices.
